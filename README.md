# Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis

This project utilizes Streamlit to create a web application that analyzes the sentiment of cryptocurrency-related posts on Reddit. By leveraging the CryptoBERT model, the app can determine whether the overall sentiment of a post is bullish, neutral, or bearish. This tool can be invaluable for traders, investors, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Search by Token**: Allows users to enter a cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., $BTC, $ETH, $ADA) to fetch and analyze sentiment from relevant Reddit posts.
- **Search by SubReddit**: Users can specify a subreddit and optionally filter by a keyword to analyze sentiment in posts.
- **Global Trends**: Offers an overview of the global sentiment towards cryptocurrencies based on the latest posts from selected subreddits.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
